    "In machine learning research, the goal is to beat the SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) performance to show that a single novel approach is better than previous ones and eventually get published. The timeframe of the problem is limited by the publication date. Available resources are also limited because SOTA only needs to be beaten by a small margin, the solution is limited to a single technique and the time limit doesn’t mandate infrastructure investment or long term maintenance costs.  \n",

    "\n",
    "It involves lots of manual labour, especially lots of micro-decisions. Automating part of this is the main benefit of the project. Further advantages are relieving employees from doing chores and focusing on edge cases and potentially expanding the scope of the project. This also enables them to take a broader look at the whole issue and make a more coherent, quantifiable and scalable approach to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard to describe, hard to simplify domain knowledge. Traditionally automation focused on rule-based systems where these can be implemented into a system and verified to pass a specification. In the absence of these, one can turn to Machine Learning for help. One sign of this is if the employees express their micro-decisions through subjective language but cannot form rules when pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of contextual data is available. Given that the domain experts themselves cannot express the rules, these must be distilled from the context of the decisions through the modelling process. This requires an adequate description of this context by the available data. The question to answer is if all information is recorded that the domain expert consciously or unconsciously takes into account. \n",
