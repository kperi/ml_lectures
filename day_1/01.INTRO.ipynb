For example, if we are building a pet detection system, we would like the system to answer that this is a photo of a cat with very high accuracy, eg predict the class of of the new image to be cat and not dog or bird.\n",

That is, if we take a photo of a random cat somewhere in the world and we feed this cat in to our system, the system should be able to respond that this is a cat although it has never seen this cat before. We call this fuction property \"Gereralisation\" and is the most important aspect of machine learning systems: to be able to perform well in unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "A parametric algorithm is one where the hypothesis function is controlled by parameters (or weights).\n",

    "\n",
    "A typicall example of non-parametric model is a very simple model, known as the kNN algorithm as we will see bellow. One thing to keep in mind with non-parametric algoriths is that we need to keep the entire training dataset when we are moving the model into production\n",

One straightforwad way to do this is to compare the given new digit with every other digit we have in our dataset, pick k most similar digits to our new digit and report as classification decision the majority of the most similar votes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10 becoming 10-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into k groups\n",
    "- For each unique group:\n",
    "       - Take the group as a hold out or test data set\n",
    "        - Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "        - Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",

These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem.
